        <h1>Legally Required Content (General)</h1>
        <p>In many jurisdictions the manufacturer must inform the user comprehensively concerning all risks and hazards related to the product. The manufacturer must provide for a complete and comprehensive guide for the user to enable the user to properly and safely install, use and handling of the products. Likewise, any applicable product safety laws are to be observed in the Manual draft process. Manuals should meet at least the following minimum requirements:</p>
        <p>a) Clear, understandable and complete statement concerning:</p>
        <p>•	intended and approved use;</p>
        <p>•	limits to such use; and</p>
        <p>•	concerning other additional limits and conditions, such as limits of technical application, user qualification, user habits and language.</p>
        <p>b) Notes and warnings concerning</p>
        <p>•	misuse; or</p>
        <p>•	use which could be dangerous; and</p>
        <p>•	foreseeable misuse</p>
        <p>•	with understandable explanation and pointing out of risks for users or third parties</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>c) Notes and Instructions for:</p>
        <p>•	installation</p>

        <p>•	inspection, repair and general overhaul</p>
        <p>•	disposal and recycling</p>
        <p>This means as a consequence: Technically unsustainable, exaggerated claims of performance or the concealment of foreseeable hazards or dangers or foreseeable uses may give raise to liability.</p>
