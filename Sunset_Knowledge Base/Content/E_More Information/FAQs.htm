        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;">Do you always need to state the hazard, consequences and avoidance procedures even if they are obvious?</p>
        <p>The ANSI Z535.4 standard says in Annex B:</p>
        <p>“The word message on a hazard alerting sign typically communicates information to a viewer on the type of hazard, the consequence of not avoiding the hazard, and how to avoid the hazard. Many factors must be considered when determining whether to omit consequence, avoidance, or type of hazard information in the word message. Factors to consider include whether the message can be inferred from a symbol, other text messages, user training, or the context in which the safety sign is used.”</p>
        <p><b>When can safety messages be in the manual and not on the label? When on the label and not in the manual?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Steve Hall from Applied Safety and Ergonomics said on this question:</p>
        <p>“There is no hard and fast rule, but generally you want to try to provide messages in a way that gives people a reasonable chance to read them at an appropriate time. So, for tasks that are expected to involve referring to the manual (e.g., assembly, troubleshooting, maintenance, etc.), it is generally reasonable to provide safety messages in the relevant part of the manual, and not on a label. Conversely, for scenarios where the target audience is not reasonably expected to have access to a manual, a label may be more appropriate.”</p>
        <p>In addition, a product liability law professor said:</p>
        <p>“Whether adequacy requires in any given case that warnings be placed directly on the product involves a balance of the significance of the hazard, the user’s need for the information, the availability of a feasible means to place the warnings on the product, and other factors in the calculus of risk. If feasible, reason normally suggests that important warnings be placed on the product itself rather than in a pamphlet, booklet, or information sheet that can be damaged, lost, destroyed or stuffed in an office drawer… Depending on the circumstances, however, a warning may still be adequate even if it is provided off the product in a manual or other writing.”<sup>1</sup></p>
        <p><b>Do I always need to provide a hard copy of the manual, or can I put the manual on a CD that’s included with the product, or have a reference (website link or QR code) to the manual on the label to the company’s website?</b>
        </p>
        <p>The standards don’t discuss whether a hard copy is required or whether the information can be provided in another way. The reason is probably that most manufacturers provide their instructions in a hard copy. However, there have been manufacturers of certain products that have recently asked about not providing a hard copy, but instead including the instructions as an electronic file in the product or in a CD or just provide on a label a link to the manual on a website. Examples of such products would be cell phones, computers, TVs, and certain machinery or equipment run by computers.</p>
        <p>I have seen no law that discusses this issue and, as a result, a manufacturer could omit the hard copy and argue that what they provided was adequate under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, if there is room, the on-product warnings should tell the user to read the manual before using the product and tell them how to obtain a replacement manual if one is missing. This can be done by providing an 800-number to call or website link to download a replacement manual.<sup>2</sup></p>
