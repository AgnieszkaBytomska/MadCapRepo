        <h1>Legal Requirements</h1>
        <p>In many countries at least safety manuals are a basic requirement for selling a product:  they legally must be included with the product at the time of sale.  Often there are linguistic requirements as well — usually that the safety manual must be available in the country’s official language(s).</p>
        <p>Products in Canada, for example, must have safety manuals translated into both English and French.  Countries in the European Union also have strict requirements regarding safety manuals and their translation into different languages.  Certain countries require user manuals in specific languages. Also Further country-specific metrology and currency settings may be required in particular for industrial scales and retail scales.</p>
