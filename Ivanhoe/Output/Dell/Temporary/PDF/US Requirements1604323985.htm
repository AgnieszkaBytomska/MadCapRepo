        <p>By following the steps you should be able to create compliant  documentation (Product Safety Information in Product Manuals, Instructions, and Other Collateral Materials) with <b>ANSI Z535.6</b> for the US market </p>
        <p> A specific standard has been developed dealing with the content, location and the ways warnings are presented in user manuals.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">According to US law, a manufacturer has a duty to warn where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">the product is dangerous;</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">the danger is or should be known by the manufacturer;</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">the danger is present when the product is used in the usual and expected manner; and</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">the danger is not obvious or well-known to the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <p><b>Steps for drawing up compliant US user manuals:</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Step 1</b>:Identify the applicable acts, laws, and regulations for your product. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Go to www.usa.gov/laws-and-regulations</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 2:</b>Identify the competent federal agencies for your produc</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Go to www.cpsc.gov/en/Regulations-Laws--Standards/Regulations-Mandatory-Standards-Banst.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 3</b>:Identify which standards are mandatory for your product.</p>
        <p>Section 102 of the CPSIA requires every manufacturer or importer of consumer products that must comply with the rules set forth by CPSC to create certificates stating the product is in compliance with each regulation, standard, or ban.</p>
        <p>Product specific standards may include requirements regarding the instructions for use.</p>
        <p>To identify which standards are mandatory for your product:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the page with the overview of mandatory Standards (for example, www.cpsc.gov/en/Regulations-Laws--Standards/Regulations-Mandatory-Standards-Bans)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the link to more information about your product (for example, for Toys, find Toys, mandatory standard in the left column. Click on the hyperlink in the right column. The following page opens: www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Toy-Safety)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>See which standard is mandatory (for example, the toy safety standard, ASTM F963-11).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 4</b>:Identify the minimum specific requirements for adequate instructions.</p>
        <p>Apart from product specific mandatory and voluntary standards, there are some commonly used international standards that set out requirements for just the instructions for use. Some of these commonly used standards for user’s instructions are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>IEC/IEEE 82079-1 Information for Use</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>ISO/IEC Guide 37:2012 - Instructions for use of products by consumers</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 5</b>:Implement ANSI Z535.6</p>
        <p>As an example, the ASTM F963-11 standard gives the requirement</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Step 6</b>:Write the instructions (and other technical documentation) according to the requirements.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>The use of words may, shall and should is regulated in the ANSI Z636.6:</b>
        </p>
        <p>may: This word is understood to be permissive (use may instead of can or could).</p>
        <p>shall: This word is understood to be mandatory (use shall instead of must).</p>
        <p>should: This word is understood to be advisory.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
