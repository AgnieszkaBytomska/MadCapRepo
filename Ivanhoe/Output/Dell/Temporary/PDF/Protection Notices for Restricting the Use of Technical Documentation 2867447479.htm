        <p>The current wording on the protection of technical data in Terms and Conditions of Purchase is as follows:</p>
        <p>Technical Data and Confidentiality. All information, data, specifications and drawings provided by company to Supplier for the purpose of providing the relevant goods prior to or subsequent to the formation of the contract, shall not be used for any other purpose, nor copied, disclosed or made available to third parties. . . Supplier shall consider the purchase order itself, as well as any related work and deliveries, as trade secrets and shall therefore treat them confidentially.</p>
        <p>This wording adequately protects company  documentation is in line with the recommendations of ISO16016. It is not necessary to include a specific reference to ISO16016 to ensure adequate protection.</p>
