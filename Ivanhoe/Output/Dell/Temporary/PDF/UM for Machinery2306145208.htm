        <p><b>EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC </b>
        </p>
        <p>CE certification in accordance with the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC.</p>
        <p>.Most of our products are machinery in terms of the Directive (band conveyers, price labeling machinery, cargo scan etc.).  Please verify by yourself whether the products in question can be subsumed under the definition in Article 1 and 2 (a) of the Directive.</p>
        <p>According to Annex I Section 1.7.4:</p>
        <p><b>Information and Warning</b>s</p>
        <p>Information and warnings on the machinery should preferably be provided in the form of readily understandable symbols or pictograms.  Any written or verbal information and warnings must be expressed in an official Community language or languages, which may be determined in accordance with the Treaty by the Member State in which the machinery is placed on the market and/or put into service and may be accompanied, on request, by versions in any other official Community language or languages understood by the operators.</p>
        <p><b>Information to Control the Machinery</b>
        </p>
        <p>The information needed to control machinery must be provided in a form that is unambiguous and easily understood.  It must not be excessive to the extent of overloading the operator.  Visual display units or any other interactive means of communication between the operator and the machine must be easily understood and easy to use.</p>
        <p><b>Instructions</b>
        </p>
        <p>All machinery must be accompanied by instructions in the official Community language or languages of the Member State in which it is placed on the market and/or put into service.  The instructions accompanying the machinery must be either ‘Original instructions’ or a ‘Translation of the original instructions’, in which case the translation must be accompanied by the original instructions.</p>
        <p><b>Maintenance Instructions Intended for Use by Specialized Personnel</b>
        </p>
        <p>By way of exception, the maintenance instructions exclusively intended for use by specialised personnel mandated by the manufacturer or his authorised representative may be supplied in only one Community language which the specialised personnel understand. This exception does not apply to instructions for maintenance operations that can be carried out both by the user itself or by maintenance personnel mandated by the user. The exception applies only if the manufacturer's instructions to the user specify clearly which maintenance operations are only to be carried out by specialized personnel mandated by the manufacturer.</p>
        <p><b>General principles for the drafting of instructions</b>
        </p>
        <p>•	 The instructions must be drafted in one or more official Community languages.  The words ‘Original instructions’ must appear on the language version(s) verified by the manufacturer or his authorised representative.</p>
        <p>•	Where no ‘Original instructions’ exist in the official language(s) of the country where the machinery is to be used, a translation into that/those language(s) must be provided by the manufacturer or his authorised representative or by the person bringing the machinery into the language area in question.  The translations must bear the words ‘Translation of the original instructions’.</p>
        <p>•	The contents of the instructions must cover not only the intended use of the machinery but also take into account any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof.</p>
        <p>•	In the case of machinery intended for use by non-professional operators, the wording and layout of the instructions for use must take into account the level of general education and acumen that can reasonably be expected from such operators.</p>
        <p><b>Further Definitions</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Communication of "original" instructions</b>
        </p>
        <p>The "original" instructions are the instructions on which the manufacturer decides to accept liability.  These instructions are definitive.  The "original" instructions must come and go with the machine.  The manufacturer must draw up these "original" instructions in an official language of the European Union.  The "original" instructions are not therefore necessarily written in the language of the manufacturer.  The manufacturer may draw up "original" instructions in several languages.  It is recommended that the manufacturer indicates "original" instructions on the versions for which he accepts liability in order to distinguish them from translations which are not definitive.</p>
        <p><b>Instructions have to be translated when put in service</b>
        </p>
        <p>In practice, the translation will be done by the person who introduces the machine into the linguistic area (manufacturer, distributor, importer, user where he is an importer, etc.). Manufacturers are advised to settle this question explicitly in their sales contracts and/or in their offers.</p>
        <p>Responsibility for translation in this area is usually the manufacturer’s, the distributor’s or the importer’s, but not the end-user’s.</p>
        <p>A user who imports a machine directly performs an act of marketing and may be likened to the manufacturer.  He introduces a machine into his linguistic area and must therefore attend to translation of the instructions if the original manufacturer did not do so.</p>
